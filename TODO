Issues
    Find a way to not rely on UB on exit when component vectors are destroyed and static entities access those destructed component vectors in their destructor
TODO
    Make resizing of window not change zoom
    Make a safe login and network system
        RSA to exchange an AES key
        Think about replay attacks
    Make the ECS snapshottable
        Requires components to be copyable
    Keep a synchronized and a predicted state
        Update synchronized state whenever possible
        Recalculate predicted state whenever new relevant data arrives
    Next steps:
        spawn in the center
        don't spawn in a wall
        make sure areas are connected and you are not stuck on a small island
        write a shader for the graphics to get decent performance
        add path finding for monsters
        fix getting stuck on objects (slide instead)
        start designing skills
