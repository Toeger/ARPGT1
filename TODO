    Figure out why the template variable version of System has a segfault on exit
    Figure out which combination of values from Transformator to use to get the direction. Use an assert to make sure they match? Do I even need to save them in 4 variables? Maybe 2 are enough?

Collision resolution:
    Features:
        Deterministic
        Interpolation of positions
        Independent of order of objects
        linear in the number of objects
        quickly save and load states
        support primitives: circle, polygon, (ellipsis)
        combine primitives into complex objects
    Options:
        Box2d (not deterministic, savestating unknown, order unknown)
        OzCollide
        some other library
        do it myself
    Idea:
        Use collision detection only
        For collision resolution: Just don't resolve -> you cannot push anything, you either stop or move through
        Start with O(n^2) comparing everything to everything, make a tree for O(n log n) or maybe O(n) later
        Requires calculating the collision point (difficult, find a library for that?)

    k-d-Trees, other trees
