enemy twice.
Mines: Don't get exploded by projectiles, but do get exploded by aoe that does at least [X] damage. Explode when target is closer than [X].
Frozen Orb: Create an orb that creates ice shard projectiles that fly in a turning clockwise direction (see diablo 2 frozen orb skill)
Time dilation area: Area in which all actions take [X] times as long
Hydra: Summon hydra heads that shoot fireballs at nearby enemies for a duration of [X]
Seeking missiles: Projectile that corrects course up to [X] degrees per tick

/*
Basic data types:
    string - list of characters in utf-8. May contain spaces. One space in front and end is stripped if present.
        Example: string = Foo bar
    time - Time in seconds as a floating point number.
        Example: 2.71
    file - a string that is a file name. You must use / as the separator between directories. For compatibility reasons you may not start the file with
        "C:\" or "/" and you may not use "..". You may include spaces.
        Example: fireball.obj
        Example: Graphics Extensions/missile.ms3d
    [something]* - allows you to specify a comma separated list of somethings
        Example: [interaction]* = self, ally, map
*/
/*
Skill types:
    projectile: typically moves, has a size and can collide with an object and then applies an effect on it
    aoe: an area where all objects in the area are affected
    aura: an area relative to the user where some objects in the area are affected
*/
/*
Interaction types: Defines what a skill can affect
    self - the caster
    ally - friendlies
    neutral - neutral characters
    enemy - enemies
    map - walls, trees, ..., decides if you can shoot/affect targets through walls and if walls stop projectiles
*/
/*
Generic skill properties:
    name = [string] - unique skill name
    type = [skill type] - see skill types
    channeltime = [time] - time required to channel the skill before it is ready to be cast
    executiontime = [time] - time required to execute a skill
    cooldown = [time] - time after execution where the skill cannot be used
    animation = [file] - animation to play for the skill
    solid - If set the skill blocks movement
    interaction = [interaction]* - What type of objects the skill interacts with
*/
/*
Other skill properties:
    speed - movement speed of a projectile or aoe, do not specify for infinite speed
